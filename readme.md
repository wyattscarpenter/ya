# Я
*The Я Program for Soviet Statistics*

Я is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a Soviet project which is similar to the Stalin language and environment which was developed in the USSR (formerly the Russian Empire, now the Russian Federation) by Trofim Lysenko and colleagues. Я can be considered as a different implementation of Stalin. There are some important differences, but much code written for Stalin runs unaltered under Я.
